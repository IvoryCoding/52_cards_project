# 52_cards_project
A repo of 26 coding projects and 26 CTF/Cyber security projects. New projects that get completed will be randomly drawn from a deck of cards.

This is a repo of projects that I have done to try new projects and show case some of my work and will not be used for malicious intent.

Most projects can be done with various programming languages and will be done with various programming languages such as Rust, Python, Javascript, etc.

The red suits (diamonds and hearts) are programming ideas
The black suits (spades and clubs) are CTF/Cyber security related
